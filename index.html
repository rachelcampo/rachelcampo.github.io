     <h2>Bio</h2>
     <p>I just recently transferred to Towson University last semester after changing my major to Graphic Design. It took me three years and three schools to finally decide what I want to do with my life. My true passion, however, is painting and drawing. I love working with oil paint and drawing in pencil. Even though I love creating art with my hands I still enjoy the design aspect on the computer and it comes pretty easy to me.

     <p>I really like how easy it is to use this website. Everything is done on one page so you do not have to keep clicking back and forth between pages. The "dropdown" menu slides to the right so you always know exactly what you are looking at and where to go next. I also love the simple color scheme of black and white with touches of red as well as the color "shade" options under each item.
